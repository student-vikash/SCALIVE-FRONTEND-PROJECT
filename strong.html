    <p>
     This is used for converting text into bold text.
     And logically ,there is a different between b tag and 
     strong tag.
     b tag ,we use for normal content.But strong tag,We use to emphasize to that content
     and we suggest our colligues that they don't have to change the content
     which inside strong tag.
     <br>
     <b>You are so cute.</b>

     <h2>About strong tag</h2>
     <hr size="5"width="16%"align="left"noshade color="green">
     <p>
        strong tag is logically different as compare to b tag.
        Because using strong tag we suggest our colligues to 
        change content inside strong tag.
        <br>
        See proper use of strong tag.

     <h2>About i And em Tag</h2>
     <hr size="5"width="30%"noshade color="orage"align="left">
     <p>
        We also use i tag and em tag for italic text.
        But logically both are different. Because by using em tag
        we suggest our colligues that they don't have to chage the 
        content inside em tag.
        <br>
        But they can change the content inside i tag simply.
        <br>
        See proper use of i and em tag:-<br>

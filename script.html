       <b><Paragraph On Bhimrao Ambedkar:</b>
        <br>
        <br>
         Bhimrao Ambedkar is termed as the father of the Constitution of India. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Though he hailed from a socially backward caste, he rose to unparalleled height. 
         As a result of casteism, he was subjected to blatant discrimination at school.  
         However, it did not hold him back from attaining excellent marks and pursuing higher education. 
         He was determined to bring about a radical change in society.
